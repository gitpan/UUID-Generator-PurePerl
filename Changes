        - released as 0.05
          (code except $VERSION is quite the same as 0.04_02)

0.04_02 Thu Apr 23 12:30:00 JST 2009
        - added pseudo hash generator to U::G::P::Util

0.04_01 Mon Apr 13 11:00:00 JST 2009
        - changed the way to inherit Exporter's import() method
          (to deal with Exporter prior to version 5.57)

0.04    Mon Apr 13 11:00:00 JST 2009
        - modified t/31_compat for processor's endian consideration
          (binary and base64 represenation on Data::UUID depend on endian)

        - modified t/32_compat_du to check Data::UUID version >= 1.200
